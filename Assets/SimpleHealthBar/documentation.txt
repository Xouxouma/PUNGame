Thanks so much for downloading Simple Healthbars FREE!

The setup is really simple, but I'll walk you through it anyways:
1) Open up the scene where you would like to use the healthbar.
2) Drag in any one of the 6 different styles of healthbars from the "HealthbarPrefabs" folder.
3) Customize the settings of your script to perfectly accommodate to your needs!

And boom! You're already done with setting up Codiscite's new asset!
We have some more information for the nerd-ier types like myself:

---
--- Accessing the Player's Health From Another Script 
---
1) You can do this by creating a new variable at the start of your script to hold the Healthbar script data: "public Healthbar healthbarScript;"
2) In the editor, assign the healthbarScript variable to the object that has the Healthbar script.
3) Now, anytime you want to access the player's health, just do: "healthbarScript.health".

--- Healthbar Colors
---
On the script you can adjust 3 health color values: low, medium and high. Every frame, the Healthbar script will update the color of the health depending on how much health the player has:

- If their health is less that the 'lowHealth' variable and greater than the 'minimumHealth' variable, it will set the color to the lowHealthColor or a variant of that.

- If their health is less that the 'highHealth' variable and greater than the 'lowHealth' variable, it will set the color to the mediumHealthColor or a variant of that.

- If their health is less that the 'maximumHealth' variable and greater than the 'highHealth' variable, it will set the color to the highHealthColor or a variant of that.



You can find out more information by checking the Healthbar script comments.
